# hockey_statistics

This project is a collaboration between myself and Dylan Galloway to explore ways in which machine learning and statistics can be used for predicting performance of NHL teams and players.

We have developed a basic web-scraping tool and data pipeline for storing game statistics in a MOngoDB database. From this data we can extract unique insights using advanced visualizations and dashboards, and have implemented machine learning for predicting goal probability based on shot location. A sample of this work can be found in the Jupyter notebooks directory, which provides context and explanations of the data pipelines, visualizations and analyses.

Currently under developement is a classification tool for studying the behaviours of defenceman and forwards.
