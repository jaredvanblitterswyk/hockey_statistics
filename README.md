# hockey_statistics

This project is a collaboration between myself and Dylan Galloway to develop tools for advanced statistical analysis of NHL games/players.

Data is scraped from the NHL gamecenter API and imported to individual csv files for each game. These files are then processed to extract individual game/player data.

Data vizualization:
1) total shots on target and missed shots for both teams in a given game overlaid on an nhl rink
2) shots on target and missed shots for a given player overlaid on a half-rink 

Advanced analysis:
To be updated...

Note: the main code is stored on Dylan's repo: dgallow2/hockey-data-extraction ('upstream') and cloned to Jared's repo: hockey_statistics ('origin')
Fetch updates from 'upstream' before working locally
